# Week 5 - WordPress: Developing Child Themes

## Learning Activities & Resources
In the fifth week of CP3402, I focused on understanding the concept and development of WordPress child themes. I watched several tutorials on creating and customizing child themes and read more about it. The tutorial covered the basis and the necessary steps in creating a child theme and allow me to understand it more since it was explained and showed on screen.

From the tutorials, I gained an understanding of why child themes are being used, since modifying an existing theme directly is considered poor practice because the updates to the theme can overwrite some customizations. It inherits the functionality and styling of the parent theme while keeping the custom changes separate and safe from updates.

## Estimated Hours
At least 2 hours on the practical and journal, I would continue the assignment after submitting the journal, I would give at least 3 hours

## Content Insights
I gained more insight of the importance of properly setting up the development environment, including the use of an integrated development environment (IDE) like PHPStorm and version control systems like Git. This setup enhances the efficiency and make the development process more organized, making it easier to track changes and collaborate with others. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As I stated on the content insight about properly setting up development environments, I would probably incorporate this for our upcoming assignment 2 that is a group project, since I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to collaborate with a team in coding assignments. This would give me experience in team coding collaboration that would help me in my future career endeavours
