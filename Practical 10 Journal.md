# Week 10 - Presentation Rehearsal

## Learning Activities & Resources
My part is our meeting schedule and how we used SCRUM to make our project process more productive.

We created a miro board to place our SCRUM board to take note of everyone’s tasks, progress accomplishments and challenges.

I used Canvas to make my slides and placed the contents to Microsoft PowerPoint to be able to record myself presenting for each slide.

It took me around 7 attempts since I only had 1:30 minutes to present my part. We did a total of 8 key meetings, and I explained what our goal in each meeting was and how we integrated the SCRUM framework for every meeting.

## Estimated Hours
A bit over 3 hours

## Content Insights
SCRUM framework is a good practice to follow to be able to finish a group project in a concise and timely manner. Teammates can share their strengths and weaknesses to assign task properly and discuss about their difficulties in their tasks.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Integrating the SCRUM framework enhanced the team’s project management skills, team collaboration, adaptability. Which boosts our development process, communication and time management. It is an effective way to boost my team collaboration and project management skills.
