# Week 9 - Sass

## Learning Activities & Resources
SASS is a syntactically awesome style sheet. It is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS, allowing developers to use features that do not exist in CSS (variables, nested rules, mixins, inheritance, and more).

It is designed to make CSS more powerful and easier to maintain, making it more clean, modular, and reusable when coding.
