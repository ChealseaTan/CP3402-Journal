# Week 2 Learning Journal - Overview of CMSs

## Learning Activities & Resources
In the second week of CP3402—Content Management System, I learned and understood the basics of content management systems, static websites, and dynamic websites.

Content management systems are applications stored in a database and displayed like a website. They also allow multiple users to create, edit, manage, and publish content without advanced technical knowledge of coding. Instead of creating my own HTML, CSS, etc., the CMS can handle the basics for me while I concentrate more on the website’s content.

A static website is made up of pre-built files like HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which look the same to everyone and can only be changed by manually changing the contents of the files. A dynamic website shows different information (time, location, settings, etc.) to different visitors. Instead of being stored on its own HTML, dynamic websites are built when the user requests a page. The server pulls information from multiple databases to construct a custom-built HTML file for the user. 

An advantage of statistic websites is that they are cheap, fast, simplistic, and easy to build & maintain from scratch. However, they are not scalable and lack personalization. Even though a dynamic website gives more overhead and is more complex to build than a static website, the user experience would be more personalized and allow users to interact with more functions. Paired with a CMS to handle the complex parts makes creating, editing, managing, and publishing the website so much easier.

### Practical
For my startup business, I decided on the bread subscription box idea since the pet shop is categorized as an online shop and the assignment does not allow online shops. For this week’s practical, I used InfinityFree to host my Joomla website, I explored the dashboard and got started on my website.

## Estimated Hours:
Almost 5 hours on learning, practical, and journaling

## Content Insights
Learning CMS gave me a better understanding of the subject and what I can expect when creating a website using Joomla. Reading about the difference between static and dynamic websites made it clearer for me to make my website dynamic so that I could create and handle its features better, like the forms. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Exploring the Joomla dashboard was a journey since I needed to test and try each feature to better understand them. This intrigued me more about content management systems and web development which could potentially help me in the future when I decide to make a website for a job or for my business.
