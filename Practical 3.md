# Week 3 - WordPress: installation, settings, content, navigation, using themes and plugins

## Learning Activities & Resources
In the second week of CP3402, Content Management System, I explored and understood WordPress's basic features, focusing on navigation, themes, and plugins.

WordPress provides a user-friendly interface for navigation, which is in the dashboard with other features like Posts, Pages, Media, Appearance, Plugins, etc. This makes it easier for me to find and access the features. Posts are for blogs, while Pages are for static content like the ‘About Use’ or ‘Contact’ pages. Media allows me to upload, manage, and edit media files. 

Themes are pre-designed templates that display a website's overall look and aesthetic. I discovered that they can be installed, customized, and used to give websites a unique appearance.

The Plugins provide more functionality to the WordPress website. They can add new features, enhance the existing ones, and integrate third-party services. I explored a few of the available Plugins in the WordPress repository, which contained both free and premium plans, they even showed the ratings and popularity of the plugin.

### Assignment
I hosted my WordPress on the same site as my Joomla, which is InfinityFree. But there is a problem, the default page can be accessed, and it works fine, but when I start to modify the pages (adding new ones or editing the old ones) it is not being published properly, or it would not let me publish it, I’m not quite sure if it is because of the hosting side of the WordPress, I will attempt to work on it again, if it still causes an issue, I might change the hosting site.
