# Week 6 - Project/client introduction, group project management

## Learning Activities & Resources
It took a while, but we were able to create a Slack channel, GitHub repository and Trello board. We already had a Discord server and our individual LinkedIn profile, which we connected to. 
We successfully integrated the Slack channel with our GitHub repository and Trello board. There are quite a few applications we must note, but at least they can be integrated with Slack, so we would not need to constantly go to each app to check if there is any progress in it. 
Trello helps with the task assignment and taking note of everyoneâ€™s progress on the project.

## Estimated Hours
Almost 3 hours

## Content Insights
So far, I think that using the four applications will help us be more organized and productive in completing the project. We will use Slack to centralize the actual progress of the project and Discord to communicate with each other. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning to utilize collaboration tools will help me in the future if I have any projects that involve working with other people, either in companies or freelance opportunities. Mastering them will give me an advantage in project management and teamwork skills.
