# Week 1 Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
In the first week of CP3402 – Content Management System, I concentrated on re-learning and understanding the basics of HTML and CSS again and how to use GitHub to publish my website for the practical.

This is achieved by reviewing the provided resources in my previous CP1406 – Web Development and Design course. Recalling that HTML is used for website content and CSS is for styling and formatting the website and would be best kept in separate files. Re-learning the layouts, tables, and forms and concentrating more on best practices and principles in creating a website.

I read about GitHub Pages that allows users to publish and host their repository as a website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, but only allows static sites and not dynamic sites. Which is fine since this practical concentrates more on the hosting aspect rather than the website itself. 

I had some difficulty with publishing my website with Github, since it is not showing the supposed result of my index.html, due to this I instead watched a video in Youtube to help me further understand the concept of integrating VS Code with Github and correctly publish my website. I learned that installing the correct extension would help me utilize VS Code for web development and on how to correctly configure my repository to accommodate GitHub Pages.

For my startup business, I plan to make a website for a pet shop, that possible clients can view and buy pet accessories, learn more about pet care, contact the pet shop for product concern, learn more about the pet shop, etc. through the website. For this part, I shall investigate current pet shop websites to inspire me on what I should include further for my website.

***Alternative idea*** 
Make a website for a fresh bread subscription box company called Daily Baker’s Box, so that possible clients can view subscription plans, learn about the bread process, contact the company, learn more about the company, etc through the website.

## Estimated Hours
Spent 6 hours with re-learning, doing the practical and journaling.

## Content Insights
Revision for web designing would further help me in this subject due to it being the base knowledge for Content Management System. Knowing who to target and how to design the website to engage them is a crucial part in web designing. Planning goals and content, and creating wireframe and sitemaps are the foundations of a website. Once they are in place, the next step is to enhance the site using CSS, layouts, colors, etc. to entice potential clients.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Web designing and development are mainly for designing and making websites, this would have potential use for me in the future since this is something that I have interest in as a potential hobby. It would help me to learn more about how websites are made, hosted online, and maintained in the long run.
